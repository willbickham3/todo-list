# Project Name

To Do List

{ You can view the live here -> [To Do List](https://willbickham3.github.io/todo-list/) }


## Overview

This project is my To Do List project. It keeps track of tasks that you write on the device they were written on. This project still needs some finishing touchs and refactoring to really make it shine. This was the first project that I used to store user's inputs locally on their devices. It was a surreal moment to refresh the page and not see the information disappear!

I am currently back in school for my B.S. in Computer Science so I am trying to juggle school, personal projects, parenting and showing old projects the love they deserve!

I'm currently working on a [Battleship](https://github.com/willbickham3/battleship) project!

## Features

- Ability to create tasks and assign them dates and if you have created projects, assign them to a project
- LocalStorage keeps track of the tasks on the device they are created on


### Installation

Simply clone the repo to your system and run "npm install" in order to grab the dependencies and you should be set!
